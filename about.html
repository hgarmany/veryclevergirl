	<h1><center>About VeryCleverGirl</center></h1>
	<p>
		My name is Catherine.<br><br>
		My mother once told me that I was born with a heart shaped birthmark.  I think that sort of set the stage.<br><br>
		I am passionate!<br><br>
		I am passionate about my life, about my family, and about what I do!  But sometimes true passion has to wait.  And mine certainly has!<br><br>
		I dropped out of college when I shouldn’t have.  Can’t take it back now.  Grateful that it set me up for some of the best experiences of my life!<br><br>
		I have thrived in what was once considered a male dominated industry.  Yes.  I was the only woman in a field of men.  Thankful to say that has now changed.<br><br>
		I married late and started raising a family even later.<br><br>
		Along the way, I put aside one true dream I had, that stopped when I dropped out of college.  I wanted to be an artist.<br><br>
		Although I was successful in my field, the one thing that gnawed at the back of my soul was, “I want to be an artist.”<br><br>
		I dabbled.  I painted.  I created.  But only when everything else was taken care of, so far too often, not often enough.<br><br>
		I am happy to say I actually created and sold a corporate logo, I have illustrated children’s books, I have created bridal signage and so many personal 
		gifts over the years, that I think my friends sometimes wish for just a gift card!<br><br>
		But in the end, all I really wanted…was to be an artist.<br><br>
		The course of my life has changed multiple times.<br><br>
		The greatest joy in life was the birth of my son, Hugh.  And then I was given yet another wonderful gift with the birth of my son, 
		Mitchell.<br><br>
		They helped me see through a child’s eyes again.  My childhood, sometimes difficult, left me somewhat melancholy.  For the longest time, I actually didn’t 
		have much self confidence and lacked the ability to understand how much I could actually do if I put my mind to it.<br><br>
		With my sons, I have gone on wonderful adventures.  But along the way with these two sidekicks, I kept thinking…I still want to be an artist.<br><br>
		When it came time to rejoin the workforce, my old career had been replaced with new technology and I was no longer relevant.<br><br>
		I took what some might consider demeaning jobs to help put food on the table and show, “I could still do it.”  All the time thinking…I want to be an artist.<br><br>
		FINALLY! I finally actually got a job working in a career in and around artists!   I am honored to see the gifted and talented individuals and their creations 
		on a daily basis.  I take great inspiration from them and hope I have half their talent!<br><br>
		But I still held back.<br><br>
		It wasn’t until I took an online art class some months ago that while waiting for the class to begin, I thought to myself, “I AM an artist!”<br><br>
		I finally recognized that all this time, I still found the time, when I could, to do what made me the most happy creatively.  I have exposed my children 
		to all types of creative art and although they personally don’t practice on a daily basis, have found to be a foundation for a great appreciation of art 
		in all its forms.<br><br>
		I currently mostly practice in mixed-media art.  This allows me to utilize found objects and incorporate techniques in images to create something surreal.<br><br>
		For now, I will remain an “UNDERCOVER ARTIST”. Although my daytime job is a fact of life, I have found a way to merge my dreams into this reality.<br><br>
		As you come on my journey of expression and enlightenment, you will notice a few things about me:<br>
		
		<ul class='heart'>
		<li><p>I love my husband and my sons more than life itself.</p></li>
		<li><p>I love hearts and dots in my work.  You will see them crop up from time to time.</p></li>
		<li><p>I do want world peace and hope that one day the human race can get their act together and learn to live with one another in love.</p></li>
		<li><p>I am happiest creating.</p></li>
		<li><p>I love learning.</p></li>
		<li><p>I greet each day grateful for my life.</p></li>
		<li><p>I end each day thankful for the opportunity to do something meaningful.</p></li>
		</ul>
