2|A Mother's Day Floral Bouquet|Shopping Christmas holiday closeouts can be rewarding! That’s when I saw the clear plastic ornaments and a “Happy New Year” coaster pack. A cardboard Christmas tree flipped upside down is the perfect cone for a Mother’s Day bouquet. These projects are a finished gift that any mother would be happy to display well past Mother’s Day!|Stmp-Soldered-Ornaments.jpg|https://stampington.com/A-Mothers-Day-Floral-Bouquet-Project|Stampington
3|Inspired by Mom Soldered Ornaments|I love putting together soldered slide images! A simple sentiment and some patterned paper transform these glass slides into tiny pieces of art. Mothers will love the personalized touch to these simple framed works of art.|Stmp-Mothers-Day.jpg|https://stampington.com/Mom-Inspired-Soldered-Ornaments-Project|Stampington
